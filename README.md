# Pandas-Challenge
Module 4 Challenge
This project was indended to merge two csv data sets to determine which schools have a higher/lower budget in total and by student. Was also to see which school had a higher passing rate in Math, Reading, and overall.  This project was also to be able to split certain types of data from the merged csv file to show that you can simply write up a code to view and store individual data or grouped data, which in much larger data sets would show to be incredibly useful.
